# TYPO3 extension `crawler_core`

`crawler_core` provides basic functionality to crawl a request queue
in a generic way, which can be specialized through several ways. Thus
makeing this extension a proper generic player without a full blown,
overhelming feature and configuration list.

Note: This is just a kickoff for the extension yet. Code with proper
      code and tests will follow.
